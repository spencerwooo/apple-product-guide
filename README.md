## üì¶ Deploying

- Install [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) ‚Äî‚Äî Package Management for Golang
- Install dependencies:

```
glide install
```

- Build project:

```shell
go build
```

- Set environment variable `$PORT` for local server to listen to:

```shell
export PORT=9000
```

- Run project locallyÔºö

```shell
./apple-product-guide
```

## üßÆ How is this done?

`main.go` defines a CRON task, which will execute `crawler.go` once every hour. `crawler.go` will automatically fetch the latest data from MacRumors' website, and store the data locally in JSON format.

`main.go` will also execute the API server in another thread defined in `server.go`. Upon every request, `server.go` will read from `data.json` and respond with the corresponding data.
